# Project-Starter

Please use the provided folder structure for your docs (scope & charter, design documenation, communications log, weekly logs and final documentation), source code, tesing, etc.    You are free to organize any additional internal folder structure as required by the project.  Please use a branching workflow and once an item is ready, do remember to issue a PR, review and merge in into the master brach.
