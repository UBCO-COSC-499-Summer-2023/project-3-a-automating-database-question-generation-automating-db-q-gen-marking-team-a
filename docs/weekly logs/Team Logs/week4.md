# Week 4

## Sunday, June 4
Held a team meeting to finalise the Charter & Scope document as well as finish the first draft of the Design document. The team realised that several requirements were missing and that the use cases ought to be smaller and more self-contained. The new requirements include allowing a professor to see the solution and allow a professor to set the answer visibility.
