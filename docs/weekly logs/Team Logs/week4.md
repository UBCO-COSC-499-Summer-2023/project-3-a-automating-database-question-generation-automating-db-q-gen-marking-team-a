# Week 4

## Sunday, June 4
Held a team meeting to finalise the Charter & Scope document as well as finish the first draft of the Design document. The team realised that several requirements were missing and that the use cases ought to be smaller and more self-contained. The new requirements include allowing a professor to see the solution and allow a professor to set the answer visibility.  

## Wednesday, June 8
Held a team meeting before the report mostly to talk about various issues as well as progress made. Both the SQL and RelaX sides have managed to put the editor itself into PrairieLearn, however there is little-to-no functionallity of the editors. The team also went over the presentation slide deck to discuss and further contribute.  

## Thursday, June 9
The team made many small adjustements to the slide deck and design document (mostly spelling mistakes and tweaks to the design documents), along with one or two major changes (reworked the testing section of the slidedeck and reworked the level 1 DFD to include a second system of the user's web browser). The design document was fully reviewed and submitted, and so was the design presentation.
The team practiced presenting the slide deck.
