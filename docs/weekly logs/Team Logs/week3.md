# Week 3

## Sunday, May 28
Went over the Charter and Scope document, adjusting things as necessary. When it was deemed that the Charter draft was complete, a PDF was created and it was submitted.  

## Wednesday, May 31
We had no formal meetings in the days prior to May 31st, but a great deal of time was spent discussing Docker issues in the team chat.  
On May 31st the team met at 08:30, well before the report at 10:50. The main topic was Docker, a problem for which no solutions have been found: three members of the group were to focus on the week's milestone while the last member (Matthew) was to focus on Docker. In addition, the group was to ask both Dr. Scott and Dr. Lawrence about Docker. Other topics of the meeting included discussing the existing design documentation and diagrams, what still had to be done before the milestone's due date (user groups, personas, jounrey lines, UI mockup, document write up, and T-shirt sizing), as well as what needed to be done to prepare for the first report. The team decided that after their report, they would continue the meeting to do the T-shirt sizing.  
The team had their report with Dr. Scott. It went well, other than the Docker issue being left unresolved.  
After the report, the team continued their meeting with the T-shirt sizing. When that was finished, the meeting ended.

## Friday June 2
Before the report, the team held a meeting to further discuss Docker issues. It had almost entirely been solved, with Docker successfully working on everyone's machines but one person. The team also discussed several problems that would later come during the actual development phase. The team also spent sime time reading PrairieLearn documentaion.  
The team had a short report with Scott. Docker was the main topic.  
The team had a meeting with their client where scope was clarified (live question generation is not a requirement, randomization of questions is a stretch but should be easy, and giving partial marks for questions was added to stretch goals), advice was given (the RelaX editor can be placed within an iFrame directly in PrairieLearn, and trying to run SQLite directly in the browser may be easier), and discussed our project in relation to the previous year's project (at the end of the project, the old repository should be merged with the new one such that Dr. Lawrence does not have to maintain two repositories).  
Afterwards, the team discussed what they needed to do before the next milestone (Sunday, June 4th). Not much: update charter and finish up the design document.
