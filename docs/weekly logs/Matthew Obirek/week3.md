# Week 3

## Sunday, May 28

began to log activity

## Monday, May 29
Started work on Docker troubleshooting. Got PrairieLearn Running, But the format for the AutoER project is wrong.

the AutoER js files are not running when the docker-compose file is run.

## Tuesday, May 30
More Troubleshooting. Attempted using CS411 docker files to run. Found out that the main issue is what is stated earlier, and that the Prairielearn docker image seems to have little importance to the running of the AutoER code.

## Wednesday, May 31
Team Meeting today - with Scott. Reviewed Scope and Charter - did good. Discussed issues with PrairieLearn and AutoER.  

Fixed AutoER Question Generation and formatting. Discovered that per PrairieLearns documentation, the way the ` pl-uml-elemenet` was set up should have worked - not sure why it didnt work. By moving the element folder into the course directory, Formatting, UI functionallity and Question generation is solved. I have not made auto grading work, but Andrei has.
