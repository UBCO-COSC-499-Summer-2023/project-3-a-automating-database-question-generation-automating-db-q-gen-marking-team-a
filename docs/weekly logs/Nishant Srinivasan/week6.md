# Week 6:
## Sunday , June 18:
- stil sick so couldn't work for too long on this day
- Worked just briefly on looking at how we could get started on testing locally but honestly pl file structures seem so… every file does a whole bunch of things and of those things some just can’t be tested , some need to be exported but then aren’t testable if you do that… it’s a mess but I’ll figure it out

## Monday , June 19:
- Met with team and discussed what we’re doing next, how data flows in prairielearn because we’re working on the autograder now
- Managed to get the db schema for the lab 3 questions preloaded so that students can run and execute queries 

## Tuesday , June 20:
- Managed to get the db for the lab 3 questions preloaded more efficiently and cleaned up a little bit
- Got the answer grading working , right now it’s just checking if the answer is an exact string-based match of the solution but that’s good for now
- Got the entire db for the questions loaded, all tables populated now
- Split the ddl and sql labs so they have separate elements now because they now operate a little differently so this allows for them to work independently
- Merging and git cleanups
- Updated personal logs
- Made dashboard for June 16th - June 20th night

## Wednesday , June 21:
- Worked on Drone setup this morning since it’s working now - running into issues with setting up ui tests
- Met with TA and updated him on progress
- Looked more into drone and what exactly to do, was confused
- Helped Matthew with grading of RelaX lab questions - have it working, doesn’t display correct and inputted answers but does carry out grading
- Met with professor Lawrence ; honestly feels like there’s a bit of scope creep happening and might be due to us being ahead of schedule. Not sure how I feel about what we discussed in that meeting because there was a lot of information that felt like it was newly presented to us. We'll see how it all goes though.

## Thursday , June 22:
- Drone setup is done
- Messing around with setting up ui testing to work in drone but some issues keep persisting so gonna put that off and do it separately

## Friday , June 23:
- dashboard + peer evals

## Saturday , June 24:
