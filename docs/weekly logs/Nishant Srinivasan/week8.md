## Saturday , July 8:
- worked on trying to fix the chromedriver binary error on drone, but I think it's just better for us as a team to leave all that to the very end once we've got passing tests and basically done with all the coding - it's just a matter of making our tests drone-compatible
- added some ui tests for the SQLEditor after figuring out how to use selenium a little bit more
