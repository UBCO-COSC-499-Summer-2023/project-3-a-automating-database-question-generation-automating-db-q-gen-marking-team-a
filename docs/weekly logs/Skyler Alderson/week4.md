# Week 4

## Sunday, June 4
We got together for a team meeting to go over our final version of the Charter document as well as the draft of the Design document. We notably added new requirements (student can generate new question variant, professor can see solution, and professor can set question solution visibility) as well as split our current use cases into much smaller sizes. There were also plenty of minor edits, both to fornmatting and to contents.  
I then spent a while updataing our diagrams to relfect our new requirements and use cases. I changed the use case diagrams and the DFDs, but left the sequence diagram unchanged. While a sequence diagram should show only one use case, doing so would lead to trivial sequence diagrams (user --> system, system --> user, sequence complete). I might update our sequence diagrams later if we deem it necessary but right now I don't see a point.  
Then I updated weekly logs.
