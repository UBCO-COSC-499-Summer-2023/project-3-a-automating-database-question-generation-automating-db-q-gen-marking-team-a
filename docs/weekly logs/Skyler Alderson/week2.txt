#Week 2

##Wednesday, May 24
Had the first meeting with the client and the first meeting with the team. We now have the groundowrk to start working.  

##Thursday, May 25
Had another meeting with the team. We discussed workflow. We set up our time tracking software, Clockify. We also discussed what we needed to do for the charter document, but refrained from starting to work on it until we clarified a few things with the professor (namely if the charter and scope were two different documents and whether we need a WBS/FBS on the charter).  
Created a branch for weekly logs on the project GitHub. The plan is to have a seperate branch for each of our logs–including the team log–and pull that to a weekly log branch at the end of every week (Saturday night or Sunday morning).  
Tried to use a previous COSC 499 project (one that Dr. Lawrence had given us as an example) to get Docker working. Ran into issues and was unable to get it to work: either it has something to do with my hardware (my Mac M1 Silicon) or text encoding. I will postpone on solving this, instead opting to focus on the immediate milestone (charter doc).  

##Friday, May 26
Had a short meeting after class with the team for more workflow discussion, as well as clarifying our confusion about the charter doc.  

##Saturday, May 27
Completed the sections of the charter document for which I am responsible (major milestones, budget, roles, and problem statement).  
Investigated how to use a linter and got one set up for myself (at least for Python). Will discuss linters and how to use them during our next meeting (Sunday, May 28).  
Wrote my weekly logs, one for the team (as I am the tech lead) and one for myself. In the future, I will do this throughout the week rather than at the end.
