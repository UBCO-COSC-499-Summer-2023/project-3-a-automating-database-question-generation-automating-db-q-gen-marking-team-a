    <uml-question>Design an ER diagram in UML format for a game database given these details:
      A [publisher](publisher) is identified by [name](name) and [releases](releases) [games](game).
      A [game](game) may be released by multiple [publishers](publisher), and each [publisher](publisher) gets credit for a [percent](percent) of the game. (e.g. Publisher A 60%, Publisher B 40%).
      A [game](game) is identified by [id](id) and also has a [name](name). A [game](game) has one [category](category), and a [category](category) may describe multiple [games](game).
      A [category](category) is identified by an [id](id) and has a [name](name). A [category](category) may also have multiple [subcategories](category).
      A [player](player) is identified by a [userid](userId) and also has a [name](name) and [age](age). A [player](player) may own multiple [games](game), and a [game](game) may be owned by multiple [players](player).
      A [session](session) is a particular player playing a game, and the [start time](startTime) is used to identify between sessions of the same game and player combination.
      During a [session](session), [stats](stats) are recorded. For a particular [session](session), the [name of the stat](statName) identifies it, and a [value](value) is stored for this statistic.</uml-question>
