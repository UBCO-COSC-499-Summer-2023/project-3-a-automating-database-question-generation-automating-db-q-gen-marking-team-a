    <uml-question>Construct a database design in UML for a fish store where:
        A fish store maintains a number of [aquaria](tank), each with a [number](number), [name](name), [volume](volume) and [color](color).
        Each [tank](tank) contains a number of [fish](fish), each with an [id](id), [name](name), [color](color), and [weight](weight).
        Each [fish](fish) is of a particular [species](species), which has a [id](id), [name](name), and [preferred food](preferredFood).
        Each individual [fish](fish) has a number of [events](event) in its life, involving a [date](date) and a [note](note) relating to the event.</uml-question>
    <uml-answer>[Tank|number {PK};name;volume;color]
[Fish|id {PK};name;color;weight]
[Species|id {PK};name;preferredFood]
[Event|date {PPK};note]
[Tank] 1..1 - 0..* [Fish]
[Fish] 1..* - 1..1 [Species]
[Fish] 1..1 - 0..* [Event]</uml-answer>
