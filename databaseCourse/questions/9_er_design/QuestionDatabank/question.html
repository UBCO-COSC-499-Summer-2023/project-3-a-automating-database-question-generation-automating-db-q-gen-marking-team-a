<uml-question>
    Construct a database design in UML for a question databank.
    A [course](Course) is identified by its [course number](courseNumber) and has a [course name](courseName) and [year](year).
    Different [course offerings](CourseOffering) are distinguished from each other by the [starting date](startingDate) of the course. A [course offering](CourseOffering) stores the [number of students](numberOfStudents) in the [course](Course) and also has an [ending date](endingDate).
    Every [course](Course) has one or more [learning outcomes](LearningOutcome) that are [material](material) and [skills](skills) that [students](students) should learn after [completing](completion) the course. A [learning outcome](LearningOutcome) (identified by [outcomeId](outcomeId)) may be achieved in many courses or in no current courses.
    A [question](Question) is used in a [course offering](CourseOffering) to test student [knowledge](knowledge). A [question](Question) is identified by its [questionId](questionId) and also contains a [questionName](questionName), [questionText](questionText), and [questionAnswer](questionAnswer).
    [Questions](Question) must have at least one [learning outcome](LearningOutcome) and may have many. Each [question](Question) has one [topic](Topic). A [topic](Topic) has a unique [topicName](topicName) and may have multiple [subtopics](subtopics).
    A [question](CourseOfferingQuestion) can be used in multiple [course offerings](CourseOfferingQuestion), and in each offering the [mark](mark) associated with the [question](Question) may be different.
