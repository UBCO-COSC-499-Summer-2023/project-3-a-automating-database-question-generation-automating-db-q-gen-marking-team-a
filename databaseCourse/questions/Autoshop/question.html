        The [labor cost](laborCost) of a mechanic [working on](WorksOn) a repair is calculated using his time and the mechanic hourly rate.</uml-question>
    <uml-answer>[Estimate| id {PK}; cost; time]
[Job| num {PK}; repairDate]
[Repair| num {PK}; partCost; description]
[Mechanic| name {PK}; hourlyRate]
[Car| licnum {PK}; make; model; year; custName; custAddress]
[WorksOn| time; laborCost]
[Mechanic] 1..1 - 0..* [Estimate]
[Estimate] 1..1 - 0..1 [Job]
[Estimate] 1..* - 1..1 [Car]
[Job] 1..* - 1..1 [Car]
