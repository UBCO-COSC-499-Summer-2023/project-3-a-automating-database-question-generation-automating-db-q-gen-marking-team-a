<pl-question-panel>
    A <strong>Flight</strong> table where each flight is identified by both a <strong>number</strong> (exactly 5 characters) and <strong>departure date/time</strong> (DATETIME). Note that the flight number does not by itself identify a flight as airlines reuse flight numbers. A flight departs from one airport (<strong>departAirport</strong>) and arrives at another (<strong>arriveAirport</strong>). Besides the departure date/time, there is an expected <strong>arrival date/time</strong>, and <strong>actual departure time</strong> and <strong>actual arrival time</strong>. Each flight record also stores the airplane <strong>id</strong> of the plane. <em>Make all foreign keys set to null on delete and cascade on update</em>. (3 marks)
